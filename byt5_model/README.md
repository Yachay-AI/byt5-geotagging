Yachay is an open-source platform for Machine Learning. It has collected decades worth of useful natural language data from traditional media (i.e. New York Times articles), social media (i.e. Twitter & Reddit), messenger channels, tech blogs, GitHub profiles and issues, the dark web, and legal proceedings, as well as the decisions and publications of government regulators and legislators all across the world.

Yachay has cleaned and annotated this data, prepared the infrastructure, and released a state-of-the-art Geolocation Detection tool. 

This repository is an open call for all Machine Learning developers and researchers to help us build and improve upon the existing geotagging models. 

## Geotagging Model How-Tos 

### Training ðŸ’ª
For ByT5 model training, use the following script:

```bash
python train_model.py --train_input_file <training_file> --test_input_file <test_file> --do_train true --do_test true --load_clustering .
```

The full list of parameters can be found in `train_model.py`.

#### Dependencies:
- transformers==4.29.1
- tqdm==4.63.2
- pandas==1.4.4
- pytorch==1.7.1

### Custom Data ðŸ“š
Custom training and testing data sets should be formatted as CSVs with the following columns: `text`, `lat`, `lon`.

For relevant data sets suggested by the Yachay team, please check the Existing Challenges section.

### Confidence ðŸ”¥
For confidence estimation, see `inference.py`. 
- Check the `Relevance` field, ranged from 0.0 to 1.0 
- Higher relevance values correspond to a higher prediction confidence

### Prediction ðŸ”®
An example of using the trained model is in `inference.py`.

### Current Scores
Current models have the following validation metrics:
- Median Average Error (Haversine Distance) of 19.22km
- Mean Average Error (Haversine Distance) of 434.16km 

## Existing Challenges/Suggested Data Sets
### Challenge 1 - 123 regions ðŸŒŽ

The first suggested methodology (Challenge 1) on training the model is to look into the dataset of top most populated regions around the world.

#### The dataset provided:
- is an annotated corpus of 500k texts, as well as the respective geocoordinates
- covers 123 regions
- includes 5000 tweets per location

**The data set is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1thkE-hgT3sDtZqILZH17Hyayy0hkk_jh/view?usp=share_link)**

### Challenge 2 - 12 months ðŸŒŽ

Challenge 2 sets the goal to identify the correlation between the time/date of post, the content,Â and the location. 

Time zone differences, as well as seasonality of the events, should be analyzed and used to predict the location. For example: snow is more likely to appear in the Northern Hemisphere, especially if in December. Rock concerts are more likely to happen in the evening and in bigger cities, so the time of the post about a concert should be used to identify the time zone of the author and narrow down the list of potential locations.

#### The data set provided:
- is a .json of >600.000 texts 
- has been collected over the span of 12 months
- covers 15 different time zones 
- focuses on 6 countries (Cuba, Iran, Russia, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela)
